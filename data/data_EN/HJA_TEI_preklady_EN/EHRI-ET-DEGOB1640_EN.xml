        <p>Testimony of the 30-year old dr. H.L.M. on antisemitism and discrimination in pre-war
          Hungary, hardships during his labour service, the deportation of his unit to the
          German-Hungarian border in December 1944, forced labour under German command, and a death
          march in the spring of 1945 from Schandorf through the Alps to the Mauthausen and

        on railway construction for the railway co., later we lay military cables in the ground

          <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/668090/comuna-sant.html">Újradna</placeName>. We

          type="subject">worked</term> only during the time that remained. Our correspondence (both

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1076" type="subject">troop</term>,
        so we gathered torn pieces of <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-843">letters</term> from the
        toilet. I had another incident with <term

        and kicked my bottom because I went to get hold of <term

        During the withdrawal from <placeName ref="#ehri_et_fejs_transylvania"
          >Transylvania</placeName> we walked on foot from <placeName

        We got to <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/724443/kosice.html">Kassa</placeName> the
        20th of December. We were terribly crammed in the brick <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-929">factory</term> of <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/724443/kosice.html">Kassa</placeName>. It was cold, we had
          <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-831" type="subject">no

        The brick <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-929"
          >factory</term> of <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/724443/kosice.html"
          >Kassa</placeName> had a very bad reputation. 7,000 people were kept there, out of whom
        many were <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-831" type="subject"
          >frozen</term> and remained without <term

        In December, they <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-522"
          type="subject">entrained</term> us, 75 of us in a freight car, not more. We got <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-831" type="subject">food</term>
        once a day. One day we got <term

        the other day <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832"

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject"
          >breakfast</term>. We got <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-831" type="subject">no
          water</term> at all and could not buy it either because the freight car was locked. It was
          <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-831" type="subject">full of
          lice</term> and people got <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">sick</term>
        one after the other. We had to use for the toilet either a great teapot or other pots. Signs
        of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-791" type="subject">spotted
          fever</term> could be noticed already on the <term type="subject"

        there was a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745"
          type="subject">dead</term> person, the boy next to me. The journey lasted 9 days till
          <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/7872685/donnerskirchen.html"
          >Donnerskirchen</placeName>. We arrived at 2 am after 9 days of travel and the <term
          type="subject" ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> ordered us to work
        already at 6 am. We had to <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">make
          trenches</term> and bunkers, and had no opportunity to wash. We had no <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-831" type="subject">clothes</term>
        and some had to go to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556"
          type="subject">work</term> barefoot. Here a sergeant forced me to get out into the snow
        having a temperature of 40 degrees and he also <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-562" type="subject">broke</term>
        my cheek-bone with a club. I stayed here 9 days before I <term

        with four of my friends in the possession of a service ticket which was forged. The 7th of
        January, we crossed the German-Hungarian border and arrived in <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/3045190/sopron.html">Sopron</placeName>. From <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/3045190/sopron.html">Sopron</placeName> we went to <placeName

        contracted <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-493" type="subject"
          >typhus</term>, which meant 5 weeks stay in <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282" type="subject"
          >hospital</term>, till the 1st of March. The winter was then over and we had a good life
        in the public <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-282"
          type="subject">hospital</term> of <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/3052009/gyor.html">Győr</placeName>. Later, the 1st of March,
        a 1st lieutenant of the <orgName

        us to leave the <term type="subject"

        into the collecting place, the <term

          ref="http://www.geonames.org/2766162/schandorf.html">Schandorf</placeName>. The sergeant
        who received us seized all the few things we had, he took even razors and soaps, etc. The

        searched our luggage and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655"

          ref="http://www.geonames.org/2766162/schandorf.html">Schandorf</placeName> on foot. Here
        we were crammed, 750 of us, in a single cellar. In <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/2766162/schandorf.html">Schandorf</placeName> we dug trenches
        and bunkers. We <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556"
          type="subject">worked</term> from 7 am till 4 pm. In the meantime we were maltreated,
          <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-345" type="subject"
          >beaten</term>, and struck. I left this <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject">camp</term>,
        but later I heard it became an unbearable place where they <term

        from <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-493" type="subject"
