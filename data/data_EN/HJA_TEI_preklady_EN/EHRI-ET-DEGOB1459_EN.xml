      <p>The persons in question have given us the following information: Our father was a grain
        dealer. He had a house and we made a decent living from our income until around <date

        <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1076" type="subject"
          >soldiers</term> marching to the frontline came to the so-called Jewish street. They
        blocked a section of it and then entered each house. They were <term

        and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-562" type="subject"

        <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject"
          >women</term> and sometimes even <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject"
          >children</term>. Afterwards they chased the people out of the houses and forced them to
        do <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-555" type="subject"
          >punitive exercises</term> on the street. Later it turned even worse, since they started
        firing and as far as I remember, they even mounted a cannon in the street. A few people
          <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject"
          >died</term> or were wounded in that incident. After the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-633" type="subject">German
          occupation</term> those kinds of acts became common occurrences and were
        institutionalised. The <term type="subject" ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans"
          >Germans</term> were <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655"
          type="subject">looting</term> and searching for money and jewellery all the time. We were
        very scared. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1112"
          type="subject">mayor</term> was <persName ref="#ehri_et_engelbreckl"
          >Engelbreckl</persName> and we had no cause for complaint against him. However, the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1125" type="subject"
          >gendarmes</term> saw to it that all the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-337" type="subject">anti-Jewish
          decrees</term> were put into effect ruthlessly. One day it was announced that all the Jews
        in town should <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-614"
          type="subject">move</term> into streets designated for them by 6 o’clock the following
        day. We were allowed to take as many things as we could carry. However, two days later we
        had to move from the designated streets, since the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-545" type="subject">ghetto</term>
        had been restricted to an even smaller area. Therefore we had to move into another street,
        but that time we were given only half an hour to move and we were supervised by the <orgName
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350">Gestapo</orgName>. Of course,
        they never forgot to beat us. All the Jews from <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/700646/mukacheve.html">Munkács</placeName> remember the
        so-called <q>Black Sabbath</q>. The <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826">men</term> were going to the
          <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-758" type="subject"
          >synagogue</term> that morning, but the <term type="subject"
          ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term>
        <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-598"
          >arrested</term> them on the way and said they would take them to work. Indeed, they took
        away ca. 200 <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826">men</term> and made them
        remove the gates from the street-front and later rounded them up in the yard of the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-758" type="subject"
          >synagogue</term> and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-562"
          type="subject">beat them up</term> severely. One of our uncles, <persName
          ref="#ehri_et_bleier_mendel">Mendel Bleier</persName>, was among them. The <term
          type="subject" ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term>
        <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-562" type="subject">beat him
          up</term> so badly that he was lying <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">ill</term> for
        a couple of days. After that, they forced the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826">men</term> to bring out all
        the furnishings from the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-758"
          type="subject">synagogue</term>. They even <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-350" type="subject">threw
          out</term> the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-756"
          type="subject">Torah scrolls</term> and had the Jews wash the floor with their talliths.
        As far as I remember, some of the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826">men</term> who had been
        beaten to a bloody pulp <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532"
          type="subject">died</term> of their injuries. We had nothing to complain about with regard
        to the activity of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-873"
          type="subject">Jewish Council</term>, including <persName ref="#ehri_et_segelstein"
          >Segelstein</persName> and others. We had a <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-855" type="subject">soup
          kitchen</term>, which provided the other <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-545" type="subject">ghetto</term>
        in the brickyard with <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">food</term> as well. The
          <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-545"
          >ghetto</term> was surrounded by a fence and it was <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-546" type="subject">not allowed to
          move</term> from one <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-545">ghetto</term> to the other;
        only a half hour was given a day to do that. The <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-545">ghetto</term> was guarded by
        military <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1125" type="subject"
          >gendarmes</term>, who <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655"
          type="subject">collected</term> jewellery, money and all the valuables they could find.
        The internal order was maintained by the <term type="subject" ref="#ehri_et_jewish_police"
          >Jewish police</term>. We were staying in the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-545" type="subject">ghetto</term>
        for four weeks. One morning at 7 the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1125">gendarmes</term> broke the
        gates in with rifle butts, entered the flats and chased all of us out. They were virtually
        dragging people out of bed. Meanwhile they were <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-562" type="subject">beating</term>
        everybody mercilessly, including the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject"
          >children</term>. That was our most terrifying experience during our <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-518" type="subject"
          >deportation</term>. The <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1125">gendarmes</term> went from
        house to house joined by the <term type="subject" ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans"
          >Germans</term>, who were also beating us. They jointly rounded up everybody on the
        marketplace, lined us up in rows of five and we were set off for the brickyard. The <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-562" type="subject"
          >cruelties</term> continued: those who could not keep pace were beaten to a pulp. Among
        many others, one of our relatives also <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">died</term>
        during that trip, because he had a <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292">stroke</term> due to
        over-excitement. We stayed five more days in the brickyard <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-545" type="subject">ghetto</term>.
        The <term type="subject" ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> made the <term
          type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826">men</term> do
          <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-555" type="subject">punitive
          exercises</term> and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-562"
          type="subject">beat them up</term> once again. Then they locked up religious <term
          type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826">men</term> and
          <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-555" type="subject">forced
          them to sign</term> a statement that read that they had taken the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-344">blood of a Christian
          girl</term> for the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-756"
          type="subject">Passover</term> matzo. They beat the poor victims until they signed the
        statement. They took away the wealthy people and <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-562" type="subject">beat</term>
        them to a pulp as well. We had already packed up our luggage and we were ready to go when
        they searched us once again. If they found money or any valuable item on someone, they <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-562" type="subject">beat</term>
        that person to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745"
          type="subject">death</term>. We remember an ethnic <term type="subject"
          ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">German</term> named <persName ref="#ehri_et_sefcsik"
          >Sefcsik</persName>, who was especially cruel. Before our departure they rounded up the
          <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject"
          >girls</term> and had them disassemble the empty barracks of the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-545">ghetto</term>. Those who
        refused to go were beaten up. We heard that we would be taken to work in <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/721378/diosgyor.html">Diósgyőr</placeName>. Soon they
        entrained us. Seventy people were put into our <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-522" type="subject">cattle
          car</term>, which was an ambulance car with 15 people confined to a bed. Therefore it was
        very crowded. The passengers included a one-day-old <term

          <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-518" type="subject"
          >journey</term> we had. Surprisingly enough, nobody <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745">died</term> in our car. At
        departure we were given buckets for water as well as for the purpose of a WC. The <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-873" type="subject">Jewish
          Council</term> had <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-831"
          type="subject">bread</term> put into the cars as well. There was another search for <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-655" type="subject"
          >valuables</term> in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/724443/kosice.html"
          >Kassa</placeName>. The <term type="subject" ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans"
          >Germans</term> took over the <term

        there and then we went further at the speed of a fast <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-522" type="subject">train</term>.
        We arrived in <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-2"
          type="camp">Auschwitz</placeName> on <date when="1944-05-25">May 25</date> in the early

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">clothes</term>
        assisted in detraining us. We had to leave behind our luggage. They lined up the <term
          type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826">men</term> and
        the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825"
          >women</term> separately. Then they divided the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825">women</term> into two groups:
        some of us were <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-411"

        One thousand of us <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-486"
          type="subject">stayed</term> in one block and 12 of us on one bunk. The wake-up call was
        at 3 in the morning and then we had to line up for <term

          call</term>, which sometimes lasted as long as three or four hours. We were not allowed to

        We got half a litre of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-831"
          type="subject">soup</term> at noon in large pots. Spoons and plates were unknown there and
        therefore 12 of us had to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-831"
          type="subject">drink</term> from the same pot one after the other. We got <term

        only in the afternoon. Then we had to line up for <term

        was distributed only after that. <term

        was very hard, but the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-831"
