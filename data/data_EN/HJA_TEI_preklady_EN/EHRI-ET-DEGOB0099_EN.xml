      <p>The person in question has given us the following information: During the rule of the <term

          <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/700646/mukacheve.html">Várpalánka</placeName>.
        They never abused Jews and we enjoyed equal rights with the others. When the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1034" type="subject"
          >Hungarians</term> came in, they took away the trade licenses and <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-330" type="subject">abused the
          Jewish inhabitants</term> of the village quite a lot. There was a garrison in the village
        and the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1076" type="subject"
          >soldiers</term> marching there sang satirical songs, the target of which was Jews. Later,
        incited by young ethnic <term type="subject" ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans"
          >Germans</term> they broke in some Jewish homes, led by officers called <persName
          ref="#ehri_et_kiss">Kiss</persName> and <persName ref="#ehri_et_boldog_istvan">István
          Boldog</persName>. They went to <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/700646/mukacheve.html">Munkács</placeName> every evening and
        they broke in Jewish houses under the pretext that those were <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1076" type="subject"
          >military</term> exercises. They robbed the Jews of every possession and beat them to a
        pulp. They came back to <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/700646/mukacheve.html"
          >Palánka</placeName> at 12 o'clock at night and continued with us. Terrible noises,
        screams could be heard in the night. We lived through terrible times, trembling in horrible
        fear; that was the time when I got a heart ailment. The <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1034" type="subject">army</term>
        terrorized the inhabitants all the time and <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-345" type="subject">beat Jewish
          men horribly</term> without any reason. A lance corporal called <persName
          ref="#ehri_et_voros">Vörös</persName> also behaved in such a base way that we did not dare
        go out to the street in the evening at all. That was the beginning of the terror for us.
        Then we already had to be in <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-262" type="subject">hiding</term>
        in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/719819/hungary.html">Hungary</placeName>; we did
        not dare sleep at home, we spent the nights at our relatives living in nearby towns, where

        invasion. The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1034"

          >Várpalánka</placeName>, most of them were tradesmen and craftsmen. Most of them lived in
        good financial conditions and were not short of anything. I was a dressmaker and I earned as
        much as I needed. It was the <term

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-335" type="subject">anti-Jewish
          decrees</term> against us. The inhabitants of the village behaved in a relatively
        considerate way, except the ethnic <term type="subject" ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans"
          >German</term> members of the organization Jugendheiz, who were the
        followers of <persName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_pers-000185"
          >Hitler</persName> and acted in a shameful manner towards us. We wanted to give 10,000
        pengős to the notary's office in order to let us stay in the village but they could not do
        anything. After <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-754"

        That is, they lied that they would take us to <term
