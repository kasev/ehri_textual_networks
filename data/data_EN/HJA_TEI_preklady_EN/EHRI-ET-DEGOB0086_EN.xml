      <p>The person in question has given us the following information: My <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-819" type="subject">father</term>
        was a grocer in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/724443/kosice.html"
          >Kassa</placeName>. He had two houses, the third one had just started to be built then. We
        lived in a five-room flat with my parents and my two siblings; my father was definitely
        considered a rich man. He buried somewhere a lot of <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-887" type="subject">money</term>,
        jewellery and receipts written by his Christian friends stating what and how much they had
        accepted from him for safekeeping. He, the poor man, <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">died</term> in
          <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-2"
          >Auschwitz</placeName>. I am the only one at home as yet and I do not know where he buried
        those valuables, so I do not know if I can ever get hold of them. My father was, on account
        of his decorations earned in the other war, exempt from <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-335" type="subject">Jewish
          law</term> together with his whole family. We did not have to wear the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-338" type="subject">yellow
          star</term> and when all the other Jews from <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/724443/kosice.html">Kassa</placeName> were sent to the <term
          type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-997"
          >ghetto</term>, we were told we did not have to go there. Yet, this was the time when my
        father tried to find a safe place for his valuables. Although, some days later a <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1125" type="subject"
          >gendarme</term> appeared and said that we had to go. After half an hour another one came
        and said we could stay. It went on like that for days, we lived in continuous anxiety;
        finally one day they <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-552"
          type="subject">took us to the ghetto</term> nevertheless. We had to get ready within an
        hour, and we could take with us what we wanted. I could have escaped but my parents insisted
        on our staying together. If they had suspected that our being together would last for such a
        short time, they might have let me <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-204" type="subject">escape</term>.
        They crammed the Jews in the brickyard of <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/724443/kosice.html">Kassa</placeName>, plenty of people in a
        very small place. We stayed there for four weeks. We lived mostly on what we had brought
        with us. Chief inspector Dr <persName ref="#ehri_et_csatari">Csatári</persName> was
        continuously beating <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207"
          type="subject">people</term> with a dog whip. When it came to his mind, he went in the
        block and he <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-564"
          type="subject">hit</term> whomever he found there with the dog whip. On one occasion he
        ordered through a microphone every young <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-819" type="subject">girl</term> to
        come out. He took them out and forced them to dig out thick wooden stakes from the ground
        with their hands. Even the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS
          soldiers</term> were scandalized by this; they said that for them, such things are done
        with spades. Many <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207"
          type="subject">people</term><term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-204" type="subject">escaped</term>
        from the brickyard. We were told that we would be taken to do agricultural <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term>
        but we would stay in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/719819/hungary.html"
          >Hungary.</placeName> We would have liked to believe this, but we found it suspicious that
          <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">German
          soldiers</term> were there with us. One Sunday morning, they woke us up at 4 o'clock in
        the morning. <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1119"
          type="subject">Policemen</term> occupied the brickyard. We all had to gather at a large
        place and stand there in the blazing sun till 3 o'clock in the afternoon. They did not let
        us <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject"
          >eat</term> or go for water. A friend of mine <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-204" type="subject">escaped</term>
        even from there. We were allowed to take a pillow and a duvet with us in the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-522" type="subject">cattle
          car</term>. 72 <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207"
          type="subject">people</term> were in our <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-522" type="subject">cattle
          car</term> together with plenty of bedclothes and packages of <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term>.
        It was terribly hot in the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-522" type="subject">cattle
          car</term> and we were horribly thirsty. After a three-day journey we arrived in
          <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-2"
          >Auschwitz</placeName> on <date>21st May</date>. We had to jump out of the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-522" type="subject">cattle
          cars</term> and we were told to leave our baggage there, they would be sent after us. They
          <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-411" type="subject">lined us
          up</term> and by the time I became aware of what was happening I had been in a group with
        one of my younger brothers but without my father. We who were able to <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term>
        were taken to the bath; they stripped us naked and bathed us, then they took us to block No.
        13. 5 <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-483" type="subject"
          >people</term> had to find space on one berth. We made a lot of noise and then the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1438" type="subject"
          >overseer</term> came in and struck us with a truncheon. That was the first beating. We
        lined up twice a day for <q><term
            ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-487" type="subject"
            >Appell</term></q> and if somebody was not standing as upright as a ramrod, they struck
        him. Those who went out to the toilet were also <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-562" type="subject">beaten
          up</term>. Three days later we were taken to <placeName
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-433">Wolfsberg</placeName>. We
        were put in <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837"
          type="subject">tents</term> made of cardboard, 3 metres in diameter, 20 <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207" type="subject">people</term>
        in each. We did a very hard <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term>
        there, first at road construction, then chiselled concrete in a tunnel. Our provisions
        consisted of 1/3 of a loaf of <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">bread</term>,
        some black <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject"
          >coffee</term> in the morning and some <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">soup</term>
        without any content. We <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-569"
          type="subject">starved</term> terribly and became very weak. If they saw somebody getting
        hold of a raw <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832"
          type="subject">potato</term>, he received 25 strikes on his soles and they took the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">potato</term>
        away. One of their favourite punishments was that when we came back from <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term>
        and were tired, they made us do somersaults, or we had to be crouching or jumping for a
        quarter of an hour. They called it doing sports. After 12 hours of hard <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term>
        and being provisioned like that it was difficult to survive. 10-12 <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207" type="subject"
          >people</term><term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745"
          type="subject">died</term> every day. My leg developed a <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-791" type="subject">tumour</term>
        and I had already been very weak then, so I was taken to <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-491" type="subject"
          >hospital</term>. I spent four months in <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-491" type="subject"
          >hospital</term> and my leg was operated on but I could not regain my strength after that.
        It happened sometimes that the leader of the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-491" type="subject"
          >hospital</term> did not give the patients <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term>
        for a day. I was discharged from <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-491" type="subject"
          >hospital</term> on <date>15th January</date> and they took me to <placeName
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-510">Wüstegiesdorf</placeName>.
        800 <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207" type="subject"
          >people</term> lived there in a big <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject"
          >building</term>. I was very glad, because that <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496" type="subject">camp</term>
        was clean and washing in hot water was a daily obligation. The provisions were better in the
        sense that we could go to the city and there we could acquire some <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term>. I
        was a gatekeeper and for this I received double <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject"
        >rations</term>. Much to my delight I met one of my uncles there, who worked at the kitchen
        and always gave me a little <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term>.
        When the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004583"
          >Russians</orgName> were approaching, two of our comrades <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-204" type="subject"
        >escaped</term>. We were packed up and we <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-517" type="subject">marched</term>
        70 kilometres within 2 days in terrible cold. We arrived in <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/3077505/chvalec.html">Qualisch</placeName> on a Monday, but
        we were given something to <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">eat</term>
        only on Friday. We suffered terribly from <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-569" type="subject">hunger</term>.
        What the peasants threw away, like rotten <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject"
          >potatoes</term> or <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832"
          type="subject">turnips</term>, we picked up from the rubbish pile and ate them. We already
        looked so bad that we did not even like to look at each other. Finally they put us in open
        freight cars, 60 <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207"
          type="subject">people</term> in each. We were travelling for six days; it was snowing and
        we were suffering terribly from cold too. 6 people <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">died</term> in
        my freight car during that journey. Many <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207" type="subject">people</term>
        went mad. 800 <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207"
          type="subject">people</term> started from <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/3099146/gluszyca.html">Wüstegiesdorf</placeName> and 500 of
        us arrived in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/2904789/hildesheim.html"
          >Hildesheim</placeName>. And from those only 400 were able to <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term>.
        We had to rebuild a train station destroyed by <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1105" type="subject">bombs</term>.
        It was very hard <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556"
          type="subject">work</term> to carry rails and sleepers when we had already been almost
        unable to drag ourselves along. The provisions were getting worse and worse every day. We
        received 1/6 of a loaf of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832"
          type="subject">bread</term> and some <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">soup</term>
        once a day, but it often happened that the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">bread</term>
        was omitted. The following case made a terrible impression on me: a freight car containing
          <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject"

        was standing on the train station. Those who could tried to get some <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term>
        from it. One of the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216"
          type="subject">Scharführers</term> saw when a <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-819" type="subject">boy</term> of
        14 hid a tin of <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832"
          type="subject">food</term> under his jacket. He ordered the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-819" type="subject">boy</term> to
        sit down on the ground and pressed his gun to his temple. The <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-819" type="subject">child</term>
        began to beg, so he removed the revolver from there but he put it back in a minute. This
        game repeated again and again and it was awful to hear the fear of <term

        in the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-819" type="subject"
          >child’s</term> voice, he was practically howling and whimpering of fear. When the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">German
          soldier</term> became bored with this amusement, he grabbed both hands of the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-819" type="subject">child</term>
        and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532" type="subject">shot
          him</term> in the head. There was another case when a <term

          <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject"
          >worked</term> all the time at night in a tunnel; they said they were building an
        underground airplane factory. They beat us awfully there. Hits were raining upon us
        practically every minute. <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1207" type="subject">People</term>
        were falling down like flies in the autumn. We received half a litre of <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">soup</term>
        every other day. We were suffering from <term

        It happened there that one wretch cut some flesh out of the thigh of a <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">dead
          man</term> and he also took his lungs out. The <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject">dead
          man’s</term> fellows saw that and they took the man to the back and they beat him until he
        collapsed full of blood. When he recovered consciousness, they began to beat him again until
        he <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject"
          >died</term>. I will never forget that horrible episode. An <term

        shot <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745" type="subject"
