      <abstract>
        <p>Testimony of Ulrich Arnheim, which became a part of the Documentation action, Prague.
          Arnheim starts his testimony with autumn of 1944, when he was deported from the
          Theresienstadt ghetto to Auschwitz-Birkenau. He describes his shock from the arrival in
          the camp. After a few days he was allocated to a work transport, which was sent to
          Gleiwitz for forced labour. Arnheim is pointing out the harsh living conditions of the
          inmates. He describes the evacuation of the camp in January 1945 and the death march,
          which followed.</p>

      <p>On <date when="1944-09-28">28.09.1944</date> we were loaded (1st <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-521" type="subject"
          >transport</term>) in <placeName
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-758" type="camp"
          >Terezín</placeName> and went with the strong opinion, that we were being sent to <term

          >Germany</term> to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556"

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-437" type="camp"
          >Bautzen</placeName> we became much more unsure about the destination. In <placeName
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-461" type="camp"
          >Görlitz</placeName> already we were all agreed, that we were going to the more or less
        famous <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-2" type="camp"
          >Birkenau</placeName> Ghetto. The only other was out, was that we would end up in the
        Glatzer coal mines. The hope became weaker and weaker, and as we finally arrived in
          <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-16" type="camp"
          >Gleiwitz</placeName> was completely gone.</p>
      <p>We arrived on a large, open train station tracks when suddenly the doors burst violently
        open and we heard only these words: Everybody out, luggage stays in the carriage. The first
        things that we saw was electrified barbed wire on both sides with electric lamps every 5
        meters. Further away, we saw a chimney, that had a giant red flam coming out of it. It was –
        we would later discover – one of the five <term

          >furnaces</term>, that <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556"
          type="subject">worked</term> night and day. We were in the <term type="subject"

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-2" type="camp"
          >Auschwitz-Birkenau</placeName>. We had to line up in fives alongside the train and were
        shown to a big, strong <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216">SS</term>-Hauptsturmführer
        who sorted us. (Dr. <persName ref="#ehri_et_schwarz">Schwarz</persName>) The weak, <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">ill</term>,
        elderly and those younger than 14-16 years were led into the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496">camp</term> on the left.
        Those of us who were left (from the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-521" type="subject"
          >transport</term> of 2500, 1100 were left) went to <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496">camp</term> on the right.</p>

      <p>Now that we had arrived in the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496">camp</term>, the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS</term>
        told us that this <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496">camp</term> is the <placeName
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-0" type="camp"
          >Auschwitz</placeName> camp, that <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-483">people</term> who don’t want
        to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject"
          >work</term> are <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-534">gassed</term> here, but that
        was nothing to do with us is we were willing to <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term>,
        and that we would get new <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836"
          type="subject">clothes</term>. We were led into the sauna, undressed completely, shaved,
        bathed and got new <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836"
          type="subject">clothes</term>. The <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">clothes</term>
        were the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1159"
          >German</term>
        <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-669"
          >prison</term> uniform. Then we were led into the actual <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496">camp</term>. This was divided
        into two <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836"
          >barracks</term> and the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496">camp</term> senior – a <term
          type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1159">German</term>
        felon – explained the rules of the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-496">camp</term> to us.</p>
      <p>When this was finished, we were chased out of the block in order to spend the long,
        beautiful day outside. At 1PM we got our first <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">meal</term>.
        It was ¾ of a litre of <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">pumpkin soup</term> that was
        inedible for a cultivated person. But we were <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-569">starving</term> and when a
        person is <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-569" type="subject"
          >hungry</term>, he will <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">eat</term> everything. This
        amazing <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject"
          >lunch</term> was given to us in dirty bowls, or if you were especially lucky, in washing
        bowls. Altogether, there was about 30 bowls available for 1000 <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-483">people</term>. The <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">meal</term>
        had to be finished with 30 minutes. Spoons, or other such items used by <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-483">people</term> daily, were a
        rarity for us and none of us thought about them anymore. And so, we spent the whole day
        outside, in front of the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837">barrack</term>, until at
        about 7PM when there was <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832"
          type="subject">dinner</term>. This consisted of 150g of <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">bread</term>, a spoonful of
          <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832"
          >marmalade</term> and a slice of <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">sausage</term> that could
        only be seen through a magnifying glass. After this extensive evening <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">meal</term>,
        we were chases into the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">barracks</term> in order to
        sleep. However, what one usually understands as sleep and lying down of course didn’t apply
        here. Five of us sat on a freezing cold, concrete floor and fought over space until one or
        another fell asleep more or less tired.</p>
      <p>At 4AM we were forced out of these wonderful four-poster beds and the terrible, new and oh
        so long day would begin. Three times a day we had <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-487" type="subject">roll
          call</term> so that nobody could <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-204">escape</term> and tell the
        world how nice, wonderful and cultivated life was under the liberators of Europe. It went on
          <pb n="2" facs="EHRI-ET-JMP016_02.jpg"/> like this for six days, until we were finally
        allocated to a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-521"
          type="subject">work transport</term>. Of course, nobody knew where it was going, the main
        thing was getting out of this inferno of death and the Devil.</p>
      <p>After we got new <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836"
          type="subject">clothes</term> and were bathed clean, we were brought to a train station –
        envied by those who had to stay behind – to be sent to our new <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567">camp</term>. We travelled for
        a few hours until we arrived at our destination at about 11PM. It turned out that we were in
          <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-16" type="camp"
          >Gleiwitz</placeName>. We were led to a <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567">camp</term>, given our first
          <q>good <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject"
            >soup</term></q> and sent to bed. At 4AM we were awoken and presented for <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-487" type="subject">roll
          call</term>. We heard now officially that we were in the <term

        We shouldn’t be bothered by the wall and the electric fence. The very next day we went to

        But the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject"
          >work</term> was for many <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-483">people</term> strenuous. It
        was also very dirty <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556"
          type="subject">work</term>, and on top of all that there was the harassment from the
        master (<term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1159"
          >German</term>), for whom we were just <q>cattle</q>. Add to that the very little sleep
        that we got at night and the long hours we <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">worked</term>
        with only half an hour lunch break. A normal person who doesn’t have the strength of horse
        can’t endure it. After we got back to the <term type="subject"

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject">work</term>,
        we were tormented by the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216"
          type="subject">SS</term>, <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-485" type="subject">Capos</term>
        and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-484" type="subject">block
          seniors</term> until 9PM. And so we lived from one day to the next, every second Sunday
        should be free from 2PM. For us it looked like we had to carry stones from the outside the
        whole morning long. Even the people running the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-508">camp</term> didn’t know why.
        It was just harassment. Thank God that time passed and it was soon Christmas. Eight days
        before we were told that if we behave ourselves and there were no complaints from the
        factory about laziness amongst the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-483" type="subject"
          >prisoners</term>, then at Christmas we would get two full days off. We would also get
        better <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject"
          >food</term>.</p>

      <p>Christmas came and we really did get the first day off. There was also a thick <term
          type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">potato
          soup</term> and cooked <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1159">potatoes</term>. The second
        day didn’t go quite so peacefully. We were lying in bed as the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-484" type="subject">camp
          senior</term> came in and all hell broke loose. The place looked like a pigsty. Ten
        minutes later <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-487"
          type="subject">roll call</term> was announced and as punishment, carrying stones was
        ordered. We carried stones until 3PM and then we stood at <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-487" type="subject">roll
          call</term> until 5PM, during which the dirtiest were sought out and punished with a
        beating. At 5.30PM, we finally got our <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1159">lunch</term> and then
        immediately afterwards our <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">evening
          meal</term> and were allowed to go to bed completely exhausted and battered. That’s what
        the two free days at Christmas looked like for us. But, we were already used to such things.
        What can you expect of such beastly creatures as the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1159">Germans</term> were? It was
        almost New Year. The <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1159">German</term>
        <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-508"
          >camp</term> management wanted again to appear human and let us have the day off. I think
        it probably better to say that they wanted to the day off and to do that of course they had
        to give us the day off. The new year began. What troubles would it bring for us? Nobody
        knew. But look, it began well. Our <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-508">camp</term> commandant
          <persName ref="#ehri_et_moll_otto">Moll</persName>, formerly the head of the <term

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-3" type="camp"
          >Buna-Monowitz</placeName>, and we got a new one. The first impression was promising. He
        held a speech in which – amongst other things – he pronounced that under him, there was no
          <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556" type="subject"
          >work</term> on Sundays, that the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term>
        would be improved and that better care would be provided for the many <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-483">people</term> who were <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292" type="subject">ill</term>. We
        breathed a little easier. In any case, he was not like <persName ref="#ehri_et_moll_otto"
          >Moll</persName>, and pretended at least that he had good intentions. How well he would
        deliver them, that remained to be seen.</p>


      <pb n="3" facs="EHRI-ET-JMP016_03.jpg"/>

      <p>And the next Sunday we really did get off. And once there was <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">milk</term>. But none of it
        lasted very long. On the <date when="1945-01-18">18th of January</date>, the shift coming
        back from the factory told those of us who were <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">ill</term> in bed, that the
        factory was being dismantled because of the advance of the <orgName
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004583">Russians</orgName>. This
        hit us like a bomb. And the question quickly arose of what would be done with us. There were
        three possibilities: 1 <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-541"
          type="subject">shoot us</term>, 2 leave us to the <orgName

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1152" type="subject"
          >Germany</term>. There was much commotion in the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-508">camp</term>. Nobody new what
        was going to happen in the next hours. Suddenly, at 4PM, we were given our <term
          type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-623">evening
          meal</term> and sent to bed. We were expecting an unexpectedly quick <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-517" type="subject"
          >decampment</term>. And then, at midnight we were woken up and told to get ready and at
        6AM we started out. Even the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS
          guards</term> didn’t know where we were going. We had about 1.5 kg of <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-623">bread</term> and 1/2 kg of
          <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-623"
          >margarine</term> that was supposed to be our <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">food</term>
        for three days. We started <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-517" type="subject"
          >marching</term>. We didn’t have the slightest ideas how long we would be <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-517" type="subject"
          >marching</term> for. After we had walked six hours through snow and ice without rest, we
        were told that we still had 37 km to go until we would get our first break. We were all
            <q><distinct type="camp_language">Muselmänner</distinct></q> [walking skeletons] and
        knew that even if any of us were even capable of doing it, we would have to <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-517" type="subject">march</term>
        into the night.</p>
      <p>Every so often, someone would collapse and then the <term

          would<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-541" type="subject"

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1152" type="subject"
          >Germany</term>. And then suddenly, at about 1AM, there appeared a camp before us. We were
        forced into the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567">camp</term> and more than
        1000 <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826"
          >men</term> were thrust into not very large <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837">barracks</term>. It wasn’t
        possible to properly lie down, and barely possible to stand. People were sitting on each
        other. It was terrible. In one <term type="subject"

          ref="http://www.geonames.org/3095014/kotlarnia.html">Jakobswalde</placeName>), we stayed
        until 11AM the next day only to begin <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-517" type="subject"
          >marching</term> again. We started <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-517" type="subject"
          >marching</term>, destination unknown. But we noticed that something wasn’t right. Things
        were going badly behind the front. We <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-517" type="subject">marched</term>
        at a brisk pace and without a break for twelve hours and arrived at <placeName
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_camps-7" type="camp"
          >Blechhammer</placeName> at 11PM. We were met by Jewish <term

        and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-484" type="subject">block
          seniors</term>.They were very friendly to us and said that we would continue tomorrow. We

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837">beds</term>. At 4AM we were

          type="subject">roll call</term> and <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-517" type="subject"
          >departure</term>. We however – a few hundred who were in one of the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837">barracks</term> at the back –
        had decided, that we wouldn’t go until the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS</term>
        came and collected us themselves. And we did the right thing. 700 <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826">men</term> had followed the
          <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject"
          >SS</term> and were now leaving with them. Because the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS</term>
        were in a rush and you could already here the drone of the front, the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS</term>
        were satisfied with the 700 volunteers and left the rest of us to our punishment from the
          <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004583"
          >Russians</orgName>. It wasn’t a long period of peace. The next night, an <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject">SS
          detachment</term> came and took a further 400 <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826">men</term> who had gone to
        the gate out of curiosity. In the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567">camp</term>, the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-483" type="subject"
          >prisoners</term> were <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-569">starving</term> which led to
        the savage <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532"
          >killings</term> amongst themselves. The <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832">bread</term> and provision
        stores were attacked and anybody who left carrying bread was beaten and bludgeoned until
        unconscious or half dead by those standing outside. Death came when those who emerged
        afterwards stood on the those who had been beaten and defended what they had. In the
        meantime, an <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216"
          type="subject">SS annihilation troop</term> had shown up and divided themselves amongst
        the watchtowers, using the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-483">people</term> running around
        blow as target practice. When they were finished and they were afraid as the front got
        nearer and nearer, they attempted to set the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567">camp</term> on fire, which
        for all but two of the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837">barracks</term> they failed
        to do. Finally, they made themselves scarce. The <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567">camp</term> was a terrible
        sight. Every couple of meters there was a <term

          body</term>, half burnt or bled-out and congealed in the cold.</p>
      <p>The <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-515" type="subject"
          >bodies</term> caused a terrible smell of plague. We <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-831">lived</term> like that for
        2-3 days in the most awful fear that we would be <term type="subject"

        minute by the <term type="subject"

          facs="EHRI-ET-JMP016_04.jpg"/> we were still in the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1152">German</term> area of the
        front, and <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004583"
          >Russians</orgName> weren’t coming as quickly as we hoped. On the fifth day, a brave man

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-004583">Russian</orgName> tank.
        The rejoicing was immense, because none of us had thought that we would ever get out of the
