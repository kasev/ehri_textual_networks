        <p>Testimony of Edita Ornsteinová, which became a part of the Documentation campaign,
          Prague. Ornsteinová describes the history of Theresienstadt from its beginning to the
          liberation of the ghetto by the Red army. The core of her testimony is Jacob Edelstein,
          the Elder of the Jewish Council in Theresienstadt. According to her point of you he saved
          many prisoners by his various activities. Ornsteinová is pointing out the difficult role
          and position of Jacob Edelstein.</p>

          >Office of Jewish Resettlement</orgName>. But then everything turned out completely
        differently than we expected.</p>

      <p>We built a Jewish town – what an illusion! When the gates of the <placeName

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-669">prison</term> than a Jewish
        town. It isn’t necessary to dwell more closely on the conditions at the time. When <term

        answered: <q><foreign xml:lang="de">Jetzt wenn Ihr im Dreck sitzt Juden, zeigt was Ihr

        and the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824" type="subject"
          >children</term>, and work our way out of this mess in the literal sense of the word –
        without the means, but firmly believing that we could do it. And after the first terrible
        days of shock, mutual hatred, and bitterness, it seemed that we had indeed succeeded.
        Somehow, a kind of carefree life set in. Every one of us had a place to <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837" type="subject">sleep</term>
        and for his or her things, more or less had a job, and most importantly: there was a
        peaceful atmosphere. This was one of <persName

          type="victim">Edelstein’s</persName> greatest achievements. He was truly able to gain the
          <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-483"
          >population</term>’s trust. The initial hatred of him and of his colleagues abated, and
        people started to like him. He gradually won over everyone’s heart. All of us trusted him,
        believed that he told the truth, that our affairs were his affairs as well and that he
        represented our interests before the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject"
          >Germans</term> as nobody else could. Everyone knew that they could come to <persName

          type="victim">Edelstein</persName> with any worry or complaint, day or night.</p>

      <pb n="2" facs="EHRI-ET-JMP011_02.jpg"/>

      <p>And the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject"
          >Germans</term> rightly knew that <persName
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/terezin-victims-person-iti-1296855"
          type="victim">Edelstein</persName> presented a danger to them and they feared him as a
        leader of the people. No matter how hard they tried, they never managed to create an
        insurmountable barrier between him and the people. The <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject"
          >Germans’</term> method was extremely transparent. <persName

          type="victim">Edelstein</persName> often said: They want to give us all kinds of possible
        and impossible advantages to make us forget that I am the representative of the Jews and to
        make us feel an affiliation to them, and most of all they want to cultivate hatred for me in
        the people. A small example to illustrate this. <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832" type="subject">Food</term>
        was cooked in a communal kitchen. The <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1216" type="subject"
          >Germans</term> demanded a separate kitchen for the leading coworkers of the so-called
          <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/terezin-terms-keyword-jmp-2"
          type="subject">Self-government</term> with the justification that even during military
        service officers take their meals separately from simple privates. <persName
