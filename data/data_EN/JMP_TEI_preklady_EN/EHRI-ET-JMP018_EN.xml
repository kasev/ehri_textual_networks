        <p>Testimony of Isaak Berner, which became a part of the Documentation campaign, Prague.
          Berner describes the beginning of the Nazi occupation regime in Riga and the persecution
          of Jews, which has followed. In October 1941 Jews from Riga were forced to moved out to
          the newly establish ghetto in the suburbs. Most of the ghetto inmates were murdered during
          a massacre in the winter of 1941. Berner is describing the living condition in the
          ghetto.</p>

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532">burnt</term> alive. Shortly
        afterwards, the mass arrests began amongst the Jewish population. Over a short period,
        3000-4000 Jews disappeared, I don’t know what happened to these people. All of the Jews that

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837">apartments</term> to the
        people moving out of the working-class area without any compensation, and were only allowed
        to take essentials with us that we could carry; special permission was needed if you wanted
        to take, for example, a cupboard with you. If it was a good piece of furniture, then the
        permission wasn’t granted. The <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1173">relocation</term> had to be

        every day. The large <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-545"

        that we had cleared out. They were brought from <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1159">Germany</term> to
          Szirotowa in first and second-class carriages and given coffee

          >nurses</term> from the <orgName

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1159">Germany</term> and so
        arrived quite well-equipped. In Szirotowa they were sorted with blows
        and beatings. The <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826">men</term> were mostly sent

          Szirotowa, the rest were brought as mentioned into the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-545" type="subject">ghetto</term>.
        All of their luggage was stolen and they lived from what they got from us. It was strictly
        forbidden, that we left the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-508" type="subject">work
          camp</term> and went into the <term

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-545" type="subject">ghetto</term>
        were also not allowed to come into contact with us. We went to <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-556">work</term> every day. Every
        Jew in the barrack <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567">camp</term> had to deliver
        money, valuables, stocks and gold. We surrendered 115,000 marks and a fortune in gold,
        jewellery and diamonds. The <pb n="3" facs="EHRI-ET-JMP018_03.jpg"/> worth is difficult to
        estimate, but it was a fortune. Eight days later, the first two Jews were publically <term

        in the barrack <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-567">camp</term>. One was found to
        have 60 pfennigs and the other 1 mark. After the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-541" type="subject"
          >execution</term> was carried out, the Jews were ordered to carry out another collection
        of money, golds and valuables, as it was clear that not everything had been handed over. We
        immediately carried out another collection and raised 80,000 marks. As a personal gift for
        the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-477"
          >Commandant</term>
        <persName ref="#ehri_et_krause_kurt">Krause</persName>, we kept some diamonds, a gold clock
        and cigarette case to one side for him. It was said, that he refused the gift and threw it
        into the basket with all the other things. A constable said later, that <persName
          ref="#ehri_et_krause_kurt">Krause</persName> took enough things that he could live from
        them for 100 years.</p>
