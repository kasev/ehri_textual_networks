        who was very kind to us, entrusted us to a squire from a neighboring estate, [named]

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">husband</term> on as a

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825">wife</term> recommended me as
        a seamstress in estates nearby. No one apart from them knew we were Jewish. My <term
          type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">husband</term>
        later became head of a co-op warehouse, which gave us a very convenient financial standing,
        but farmers from <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/756084/wawrzenczyce.html"
          >Wawrzeńczyce</placeName> who knew us would come [to the warehouse].</p>

        were looking for us all around the neighborhood, they called by the community leader, the
          <persName ref="#ehri_et_buchowski">Buchowscy</persName>, they found out nothing;
        eventually, they came looking for us to <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/763129/opatkowice.html">Opatkowice</placeName>. The community
        leader warned me, and at the same time sent his <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825">daughter</term> to the
        warehouse where my <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">husband</term> was working to
        warn him. While the <term type="subject"

        warehouse, the <orgName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/authorities/ehri_cb-350"
          >Gestapo</orgName> were already hovering about the yard. My <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">husband</term> mounted his
        bike and <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-204"
          >escaped</term>, unnoticed by the <term type="subject"
          ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term>. Me and my <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">son</term> went to <persName
          ref="#ehri_et_buchowski">Buchowskis</persName> place, they let me out because the high
        road and the mid-field roads were all covered, and the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-940">train</term> at the station
        was delayed 3 hours while all passengers were being searched. I took my <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">son</term> to the barber’s to
        shave his hair so that he wouldn’t be recognizable and I overheard the clients there saying
        a penal expedition had arrived and had searched through all the bushes by the <placeName
          ref="#ehri_et_vistula">Vistula</placeName> [river]. Meanwhile, my <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">husband</term> had called by
        a <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-734"
          >priest</term> he knew in <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/3092044/michalowice.html">Michałowice</placeName>, who put
        him up overnight. I went to <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/761258/proszowice.html"
          >Proszowice</placeName> to see <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-731" type="subject">priest</term>
        <persName ref="#ehri_et_radosz">Radosz</persName> and ask him for advice. He reproached me
        for not having told him before I was a Jew, he would have arranged a job for my <term
          type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">husband</term>
        in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/760778/radom.html">Radom</placeName>, and he
        would send for horses for me now that would take me back to <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/3092044/michalowice.html">Michałowice</placeName>. The day
        after a two-horse chaise arrived to collect me (I later learned that the <term
          type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-734">priest</term>
        paid 300 zlotys to rent those horses) and I traveled to <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/3092044/michalowice.html">Michałowice</placeName> like a
        lady. There I met my <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">husband</term> at the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-731" type="subject"
        >priest</term>’s place. I agreed with my <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">husband</term> we’d meet in
          <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3094802/krakow.html">Cracow</placeName>.</p>
      <p>It was utter hell in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3094802/krakow.html"
          >Cracow</placeName>. Some <term type="subject" ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_poles"
          >Poles</term> we knew were afraid to take us on, we spent every night in a different
        place. <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-734"
          >Priest</term>
        <persName ref="#ehri_et_machay_ferdynand">Machaj</persName> was very kind-hearted to us, he
        arranged for me to stay with the Norbertines for a few days in Salwator; he helped us out
        financially and recommended my <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">husband</term> for the
        position of a mechanic in the <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/3090128/olszanica.html">Olszanica</placeName> estate, 7 km
        outside <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3094802/krakow.html">Cracow</placeName>.
        When I left the nunnery I had nowhere to live and we decided to go to <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/756135/warsaw.html">Warsaw</placeName>, even though people
        scared us saying there were searches and <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-550" type="subject"
          >lapankas</term> on the trains.</p>
      <p>We went without luggage, my <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">husband</term> was only
        wearing a working outfit. We knew no one in <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/756135/warsaw.html">Warsaw</placeName>. What were we to do? I
        recalled the name of our <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/756084/wawrzenczyce.html"
          >Wawrzenice</placeName><note place="bottom">Correctly: Wawrzeńczyce</note> host’s
        daughter’s mother-in-law. I remembered she lived on <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/756135/warsaw.html">Okopowa Street</placeName> but I didn’t
        know the number. I went from house to house and finally found a door plate. I walked in and
        said I had some business to do in <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/756135/warsaw.html">Warsaw</placeName>, that my host from
          <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/756084/wawrzenczyce.html">Wawrzenice</placeName>
        sent his commends. She took me in a very friendly way. My <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">husband</term> met his
        friend, engineer <persName ref="#pawełek_marian">Marian Pawełek</persName>, director of a
        railway production plant in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/761228/pruszkow.html"
          >Pruszków</placeName>. He helped us financially. I turned to <orgName
          ref="#ehri_et_rada_główna_opiekuńcza">RGO</orgName> for <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">clothes</term>
        for my <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822"
          >husband</term>. I told them a made-up story of how I’d come from <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/761258/proszowice.html">Proszowice</placeName>, where several
          <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-819"
          >families</term> had been <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-532">shot dead</term> for
        allegedly helping the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1215"
          type="subject">partisans</term>, and since we had been friends with them we feared we
        would be finished off too and had come to <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/756135/warsaw.html">Warsaw</placeName> with just the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836" type="subject">clothes</term>
        on our backs. They referred us to <persName ref="#ehri_et_goetel">Ms Goetel</persName>. I
        dressed my <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822"
          >son</term> up as a girl, put a blonde wig with a fringe on his head and moved in with
          <persName ref="#ehri_et_goetel">Goetel</persName>. The place was first-rate, and so was
        the board. <persName ref="#ehri_et_goetel">Ms Goetel’s</persName> son-in-law, engineer
          <persName ref="#ehri_et_kulczycki">Kulczycki</persName> offered my <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">husband</term> a job at his
        company, and <persName ref="#ehri_et_goetel">Ms Goetel</persName> recommended me as a
        seamstress and gave me her sewing machine. She found out the truth about us from <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-731" type="subject">priest</term>
        <persName ref="#ehri_et_machay_ferdynand">Machaj</persName> but it didn’t change her
        attitude to us in any way; actually, she was all the more kind. Two months later I got a
        flat from <orgName ref="#ehri_et_rada_główna_opiekuńcza">RGO</orgName> in a building with
        apartments for the deported. I lived there until the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-254">uprising</term>. That’s when
        me and my <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822"
          >husband</term> parted and I never saw him again.</p>
