      <p>When the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1080"
          >war</term> broke out I was in <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/756135/warsaw.html"
          >Warsaw</placeName> with my <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">mommy</term>. I was in the
          <placeName ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-1106" type="ghetto"
          >ghetto</placeName>. There was a blockade – I was with <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">mommy</term> and other people
        in a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-265" type="subject"
          >cellar</term>, there was a trapdoor there and it was covered with rags and a certain man,
        who was in the house had a bell and he rang when there was danger, for people to be quiet
        and hide better. The <term type="subject" ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans"
          >Germans</term> came and found different people in the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-265" type="subject">cellar</term>
        in different <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-265"
          type="subject">hide-outs</term>, but ours was the best and they didn’t find us.</p>
      <p>Later when we found out that they were going to make soap from us, we went to a certain
        lady, who worked in the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-929">factory</term> and we lodged
        with her, and the next day we went to my cousin’s. Also in the <placeName
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-1106" type="ghetto"
          >ghetto</placeName> when we drove by the sentry, <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">mommy</term> covered me with
        a blanket. We were there 2 to 3 days, we called <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">uncle</term> up, who was in
        the city as an <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-373"
          type="subject">Aryan</term>, a <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1075" type="subject"
          >Volksdeutsch</term>, and we arranged how to send me.</p>
      <p>In the evening, so nobody would see, my <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">cousin</term> and another
          <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826"
          >man</term> threw me and one <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824">girl</term> over the wall. My
          <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822"
          >cousin</term> lifted me up on the ladder and passed me onto a <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826">man</term> who stood on a
        stool on the other side. There was no glass in that place. I was then 6 or 7 years old.
          <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822"
          >Mommy</term> couldn’t go to the city, because she didn’t have money. A <term
          type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825">woman</term>
        sent there by my <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">uncle</term> approached me.
        She said: <q>Come with me.</q> We got into the carriage, but because it was late, a <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1119" type="subject"
          >policeman</term> stopped us and told us to show our papers. The <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826">men</term>, who were in the
        carriage showed theirs, and the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825">woman</term> took me by the
        hand and we escaped to the barber shop. It was fortunate that they stopped the carriage
        right there, because the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825">lady</term> had keys to the
        shop. We lodged there sitting in our clothes.</p>
      <p>In the morning we went to the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825">lady</term>’s apartment, I
        had some sleep and then we went by tramway to a certain <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825">woman</term> and my <term
          type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">uncle</term>
        came there. My <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">uncle</term> cleaned me and
        took me to where he <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837"
          type="subject">lived</term>; I wanted to be there, but it was impossible, because a lot of
        people used to come by there. <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">Uncle</term> took me to a
        certain <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825"
          >lady</term>. I was there for two weeks.</p>
      <p>After that they wanted to give me to my <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">aunt</term>’s acquaintance,
        but she said that her husband wouldn’t agree and that she knew another, a better one. She
        led me to that one and I was there maybe a year. It was good for me, <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">uncle</term> used to come to
        me. I never went out, just sat in the room.</p>
      <p>Once my <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822"
          >auntie</term> came from the <placeName
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_ghettos-1106" type="ghetto"
          >ghetto</placeName>, she stayed for a few hours. <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">Auntie</term> sent to us a
        certain <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825"
          >lady</term>, who was <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292"
          type="subject">sick</term> and had <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292">ulcers</term>, a Jewess and
        later a <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826"
          >man</term> sent another Jewess. It was crowded and that <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825">lady</term> left. But she
        found out what they did to me. (when asked, he adds that something was done so that he would
        not be recognized as a Jew) and that the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-287">surgeon</term>, who cured
        that <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825"
          >woman</term>’s <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292">ulcers</term>, did it. She
        sent to us a <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826">man</term>, who came and
        asked if there was a <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824">boy</term> and the mistress
        heard him wrong and asked: what? <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825">woman</term>? Then he said:
          <q>Aha! There is a <term type="subject"
            ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-824">boy</term> and a <term
            type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825"
          >woman</term>!</q> He came into our room, told us to go with him, he took away her neck
        chain and 500 zloty, that she had in possession and a <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836">coat</term>. He told me to
        show him what shouldn’t be shown. He said that he would come for us at 12. He was also a
        Jew. We <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-204" type="subject"
          >escaped</term>. I and the host to a certain <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825">lady</term>’s. There I came
        across that <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825">lady</term> who instigated
        the search against us, and a <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826">man</term> similar to the one
        who was at us. He asked about the other one, how tall he was, how was he dressed. I was
        there for 3 weeks. Then my <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">auntie</term> took me away
        from there and gave me to another <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825">lady</term>. Again this <term
          type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-292">ill</term>
        <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825"
          >lady</term> was afraid that something would break out and wanted me to be close to her
        and she moved me to <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/756135/warsaw.html">Piusa
          Street</placeName>, because she was on <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/756135/warsaw.html">Marszałkowska</placeName>, so I would be
        close to her.</p>
      <p>When the <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-254"
          >uprising</term> broke out, <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822">auntie</term> just brought
          <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-832"
          >milk</term> for me and came to us. The <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826">husband</term> of the <term
          type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825">lady</term>,
        at whose I was, was a company sergeant in the <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-254">uprising</term>. When the
          <term type="subject" ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_germans">Germans</term> told us to leave,
        we went with the whole house to the railway station, we lost one another, I almost lost my
          <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822"
          >aunt</term>, because it was heavy with the knapsack and I walked slowly, but I called her
        and held her hand. We went via a goods <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-940">train</term> to <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/761228/pruszkow.html">Pruszków</placeName>, we were there in
        a <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-505" type="subject"

          ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_russians">Russians</term> were,
        they played very nice. When we were leaving those <term type="subject"
          ref="#ehri_et_nationalities_russians">Russians</term> had
        tears in their eyes.</p>
      <p>We went for 3 days and nights, they let us out in <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/3093768/lazy.html">Łazy</placeName> because it was necessary
        to go out, but they led us under machine guns. People in <placeName

        for <term type="subject" ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-745"
          >death</term>. They didn’t want to take us in <placeName

          >Oświęcim</placeName>, they were <term type="subject"
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-516">burning</term> 120 000 people
        a day and didn’t have room. They detrained us in <placeName
          ref="http://www.geonames.org/764276/mszana-dolna.html">Mszana</placeName> and from there
        we went to <placeName ref="http://www.geonames.org/3094802/krakow.html"

      <p>Now I am with my <term type="subject"
