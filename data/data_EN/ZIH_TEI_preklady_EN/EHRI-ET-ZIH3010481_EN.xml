        are here and that when we are bathed then everyone would be reunited with their family,
        would get new <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-836"

        ran up to us as we were <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-555"

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-822" type="subject">sisters</term>
        again, we took us to a big <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-944" type="subject">yard</term>
        where there were huge piles of <term

          >clothing</term>, suitcases, men’s and women’s shoes, baggage, <term

        and mounds of other things, then the <term

        ordered us to take off our coats and start <term

        >working</term>, the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943"

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-411" type="subject">sorting</term>
        every thing: shoes with shoes, coats with cots, etc. Not knowing anything about what was
        going on there, I asked a few boys, but no one gave me a real answer, I just found out that
        we were not permitted to <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-658"
          type="subject">talk</term> to each other, suddenly I recognized someone I knew who used to
        live in one of the buildings in our courtyard, he was taken away 4 days before I was, so
        having asked him what this was here and where all the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-826" type="subject">men</term> and
          <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-825" type="subject"
          >women</term> were, he turned away, and with tears in his eyes, he told me just one word:
          <q>you don’t have any mother or sister any more</q>. Before he managed to tell me what
        happened to them and how, 2 <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-1159" type="subject"
          >Germans</term> ran up to us and started to thrash us in the head with <term

        then an additional 25 blows on our bare <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-555" type="subject">bodies</term>.
        I got up from the ground with great difficulty, after we <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-411" type="subject">sorted</term>
        things for another 2 hours until 10 o'clock in the evening, they herded us to the <term

        at us and <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-562" type="subject"
          >torture</term> us mercilessly, with whatever they could. We pushed against each other
        like sheep, and when I fell to the ground, I was <term

        the fingers with a bayonet. After an hour of being chased like that, they <term

        100 boys, including the hero [who had stabbed <persName ref="#ehri_et_bialas_max"

          >barracks</term> that I managed to rip a piece of my <term

        off to bandage my hand, each one of us laid down on the ground, crying and in <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-791" type="subject">pain</term>,
        to rest a little. The boys who had already been there for a few days or weeks already knew

        They opened the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-837"
          type="subject">barracks</term> only at 11 o'clock in the morning, shouting <q><foreign

        shoes and took 50 boys away including me, telling us that we were only going to do some
        light <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-943" type="subject"
          >work</term> for 10 minutes, and took us through the whole yard to some gate, and when we
        went through that gate my blood froze, I saw a heap of dead <term

        lying on the ground, and bloodied boys going up to them with stretchers, grabbing <term

        by the hands and legs, they laid them on the stretcher and ran away with them, thinking
        about all of this, I looked on with tears in my eyes, and all of a sudden I felt a blow to
        my head with a riding crop, the boys who were already there for a few days told us that two
        boys should take a stretcher and <term

          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-499" type="subject">gas
          chambers</term> they hit us with <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-564" type="subject">whips</term>,
        shouting: <q>faster, you dogs</q>. I ran to the ramp quickly, we put the stretcher on the
        ground and clumsily laid the <term
          ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-515" type="subject">corpse</term>
        onto the stretcher, at this moment the <term

          >Germans</term> began to <term

        us mercilessly, they threw me to the ground and kicked me in the head, shouting that I
        hadn’t picked up the<term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-515"
          type="subject">corpse</term> the right way, that we were supposed to pick them up by the
        hands and feet and lay them down evenly on the stretcher. I got up off the ground with
        difficulty and taking the stretcher with my friend, we ran in the direction of the <term

        were thrown into the <term ref="https://portal.ehri-project.eu/keywords/ehri_terms-539"
